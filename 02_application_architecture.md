## Overview

Application architecture defines the patterns and techniques used to design and build an application. It provides a roadmap for the development of a software application and ensures that it meets business requirements while maintaining technical standards.

## Hybrid Architectures

Hybrid architectures combine multiple architectural patterns to leverage the strengths of each while mitigating their individual weaknesses. This approach allows organizations to optimize their architecture for specific business needs and constraints.

### Common Hybrid Patterns

1. Monolithic + Microservices
   - Keep core business logic in monolith
   - New features developed as microservices
   - Gradual migration strategy
   - Benefits:
     - Reduced risk in migration
     - Incremental modernization
     - Maintain stability of core systems
2. Microservices + Serverless

   - Core services as microservices
   - Event-driven functions as serverless
   - Benefits:
     - Cost optimization
     - Flexible scaling
     - Better resource utilization

3. Client-Server + Event-Driven
   - Traditional client-server for CRUD operations
   - Event-driven for real-time features
   - Benefits:
     - Improved user experience
     - Better handling of real-time updates
     - Scalable notification system

### Implementation Considerations

1. Integration Points

   - API Gateway management
   - Service mesh implementation
   - Data consistency strategies
   - Authentication/Authorization

2. Deployment Strategy

   - Containerization
   - Orchestration tools
   - CI/CD pipeline adaptation
   - Multiple deployment models

3. Monitoring and Management
   - Unified logging
   - Distributed tracing
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error handling across patterns

### When to Choose Hybrid

- Complex enterprise applications
- Legacy system modernization
- Mixed workload requirements
- Varying scalability needs
- Different security requirements
- Cost optimization needs

## Common Application Architecture Patterns

### 1] Monolithic Architecture

- A traditional unified model for designing a software application
- Key characteristics:

  - Single-tiered software application
  - Self-contained and independent from other applications
  - All components are interconnected and interdependent
  - Single codebase and deployment unit

- Components:

  - User Interface
  - Business Logic
  - Data Access Layer
  - All in one deployable unit

- Advantages:

  - Simple to develop and deploy
  - Easy to test
  - Simple to scale horizontally
  - Less cross-cutting concerns
  - Better performance due to local calls

- Disadvantages:
  - Becomes complex as application grows
  - Continuous deployment is challenging
  - Limited to one technology stack
  - Reliability (single point of failure)
  - Difficult to scale individual components

### 2] Microservices Architecture

- Structures application as a collection of loosely coupled services
- Key characteristics:

  - Services are independently deployable
  - Each service runs in its own process
  - Services communicate via well-defined APIs
  - Each service has its own database

- Core components:

  - API Gateway
  - Service Registry
  - Config Server
  - Individual Services
  - Message Brokers
  - Databases per service

- Advantages:

  - Independent deployment
  - Technology diversity
  - Improved fault isolation
  - Easy scaling per service
  - Better team autonomy

- Disadvantages:
  - Distributed system complexity
  - Network latency
  - Data consistency challenges
  - Complex testing and deployment
  - Operational overhead

### 3] Event-Driven Architecture

- Design pattern built around the production, detection, and reaction to events
- Key characteristics:

  - Asynchronous communication
  - Loose coupling
  - Event producers and consumers
  - Event-driven flow

- Components:

  - Event Producers
  - Event Channels
  - Event Processors
  - Event Consumers
  - Event Store

- Advantages:

  - Highly scalable
  - Loose coupling
  - Easy to extend
  - Real-time processing
  - Better responsiveness

- Disadvantages:
  - Complex error handling
  - Event versioning challenges
  - Eventual consistency
  - Testing complexity
  - Debugging challenges

### 4] Serverless Architecture

- Builds applications that don't require direct server management
- Key characteristics:

  - No server management
  - Pay-per-execution
  - Auto-scaling
  - Event-driven execution

- Components:

  - Function as a Service (FaaS)
  - Backend as a Service (BaaS)
  - API Gateway
  - Cloud Services
  - Storage Services

- Advantages:

  - Reduced operational costs
  - No server management
  - Automatic scaling
  - Faster time to market
  - Pay for actual usage

- Disadvantages:
  - Vendor lock-in
  - Cold starts
  - Limited execution duration
  - Complex monitoring
  - Limited local testing

### 5] Client-Server Architecture

- Distributes computing between clients and servers
- Key characteristics:

  - Two-tier architecture
  - Centralized control
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Network-based communication

- Components:

  - Client Application
  - Server Application
  - Network Protocol
  - Database
  - Load Balancer

- Advantages:

  - Centralized data storage
  - Easy maintenance
  - Role-based access
  - Scalable server side
  - Resource sharing

- Disadvantages:
  - Server dependency
  - Network issues impact
  - Potential bottlenecks
  - Complex server setup
  - Security challenges
